<Info>
**Time to Complete**: ~5 minutes  
**What You'll Learn**: How to create a wallet, register a file, and verify its provenance using Trust Engine
</Info>



## Step 1: Health Check

First, let's make sure the Trust Engine API is operational:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET https://core-api-server.onrender.com/health
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://core-api-server.onrender.com/health');
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://core-api-server.onrender.com/health')
print(response.json())
```
</CodeGroup>

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "All systems operational!",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z"
}
```

---

## Step 2: Create Your Wallet

Create a Crossmint wallet that will own your registered files:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://core-api-server.onrender.com/create-wallet \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userID": "my-unique-id-123"}'
```

```javascript JavaScript (SDK)
const wallet = await sdk.createWallet({
  userID: 'my-unique-id-123'
});

console.log('Wallet created:', wallet.details.walletAddress);
const walletAddress = wallet.details.walletAddress;
```

```bash CLI
core-api-cli create-wallet \
  --userID "my-unique-id-123"
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
**⚠️ ONE-TIME OPERATION**: This wallet creation step should only be performed **once per user**. The Crossmint wallet that gets generated will be used for **all future file registrations** by this user. Save the `walletAddress` from the response and reuse it for subsequent registrations instead of creating new wallets. If you ever forget your wallet address, you can always use your user ID to remember it using our API!
</Warning>

**Save the wallet address** from the response - you'll need it for the next step!

---

## Step 3: Prepare Your File

For this example, let's register a simple text file. Create the file first:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
# Create example file
echo "Hello, Trust Engine!" > example.txt

# Calculate SHA256 hash
shasum -a 256 example.txt
# Output: a7b2c3d4e5f6... example.txt

# Get file size
wc -c < example.txt
# Output: 21
```

```javascript JavaScript (SDK)
import { CoreApiSDK } from '@trust-engine/sdk';

const sdk = new CoreApiSDK();

// Create example file (in browser, this would be from file input)
const fileContent = "Hello, Trust Engine!";
const file = new File([fileContent], "example.txt", { type: "text/plain" });

console.log('File ready for registration');
```

```bash CLI
# Create example file
echo "Hello, Trust Engine!" > example.txt

# The CLI will automatically handle hash calculation
ls -la example.txt
```
</CodeGroup>

---

## Step 4: Register Your File

Now register your file using the wallet from Step 2:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://core-api-server.onrender.com/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "contentTitle": "My First Registration",
    "walletAddress": "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE",
    "walletType": "crossmint",
    "contentHash": "a7b2c3d4e5f6789abcdef...",
    "fileMetadata": {
      "fileName": "example.txt",
      "fileSize": 21,
      "mimeType": "text/plain"
    },
    "metadata": "Quickstart tutorial example"
  }'
```

```javascript JavaScript (SDK)
const registration = await sdk.registerFile({
  file: file, // The File object from Step 3
  contentTitle: 'My First Registration',
  walletAddress: walletAddress, // From Step 2
  walletType: 'crossmint',
  metadata: 'Quickstart tutorial example'
});

console.log('File registered!', registration);
```

```bash CLI
# Register the file (replace YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS with actual address)
core-api-cli register \
  --file example.txt \
  --contentTitle "My First Registration" \
  --walletAddress "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE" \
  --walletType "crossmint" \
  --metadata "Quickstart tutorial example"
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
**Note**: We're using Crossmint wallets which handle transaction signing automatically. For standard wallets, additional signing steps are required.
</Info>

**Expected Response (Crossmint):**
```json
{
  "message": "✅ Accepted! Your file has been submitted and is being processed by Crossmint.",
  "details": {
    "status": "processing",
    "crossmintTransactionId": "abc123...",
    "contentRegistrationPDA": "xyz789...",
    "contentHash": "a7b2c3d4...",
    "ipfsCid": "QmExample..."
  }
}
```

---

## Step 5: Verify Your Registration

Search for your registered file to confirm it's in the system:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://core-api-server.onrender.com/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"contentHash": "a7b2c3d4e5f6789abcdef..."}'
```

```javascript JavaScript (SDK)
const results = await sdk.searchFile(file); // Pass the same file from Step 3

console.log('Search results:', results);
```

```bash CLI
core-api-cli search-file \
  --file example.txt
```
</CodeGroup>

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Found 1 record(s) for your file on the blockchain.",
  "details": [
    {
      "contentHash": "a7b2c3d4...",
      "pdaAddress": "xyz789...",
      "onChainRegistration": {
        "creator": "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS",
        "ipfsCid": "QmExample...",
        "timestamp": 1640995200,
        "finalized": false,
        "consensusPercentage": 0
      },
      "userID": "my-unique-id-123"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Understanding Your Results

- **`finalized: false`**: Your file is registered but validators are still verifying it
- **`consensusPercentage: 0`**: Verification is in progress (will show percentage when validators vote)
- **`pdaAddress`**: Your unique on-chain record address
- **`ipfsCid`**: Metadata stored on IPFS
