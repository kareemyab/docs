# Trust Engine find-wallet

> Find a wallet by user ID or wallet address

The find-wallet command allows you to search for wallet associations in the Trust Engine system. You can search by either a user ID to find their associated wallet, or by a wallet address to find the associated user.

To use it, run the following command from your terminal

```bash
trust-engine-cli find-wallet [options]
```

## Options

| Option                      | Description                                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `-u, --userID <id>`         | User ID to search for (alphanumeric string)      |
| `-w, --walletAddress <address>` | Wallet address to search for (Solana public key) |
| `--json`                    | Output the result as JSON                         |

<Note>
You must provide either a `userID` or a `walletAddress` (but not both).
</Note>

## Examples

Find a wallet by user ID:

```bash
trust-engine-cli find-wallet --userID "user_12345"
```

After running the command, you'll see search results:

```
âœ… Wallet association found.

Search Details:
  - Search Type: userID
  - Search Value: user_12345

Wallet Association Found:
  - User ID: user_12345
  - Wallet Address: 9WzDXwBbmkg8ZTbNMqUxvQRAyrZzDsGYdLVL9zYtAWWM
  - Created At: 2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z
  - Relation PDA: 9MzRqTnV8mYpH4xL9WvNfEtY2jDw5mVpQcfGKJH2mNqR
```

You can also search by wallet address:

```bash
trust-engine-cli find-wallet --walletAddress "9WzDXwBbmkg8ZTbNMqUxvQRAyrZzDsGYdLVL9zYtAWWM"
```

For automation purposes, use the JSON output:

```bash
trust-engine-cli find-wallet --userID "user_12345" --json
```

This will return:

```json
{
  "message": "Wallet association found.",
  "details": {
    "searchType": "userID",
    "searchValue": "user_12345",
    "relation": {
      "userId": "user_12345",
      "walletAddress": "9WzDXwBbmkg8ZTbNMqUxvQRAyrZzDsGYdLVL9zYtAWWM",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z",
      "relationPDA": "9MzRqTnV8mYpH4xL9WvNfEtY2jDw5mVpQcfGKJH2mNqR"
    }
  }
}
```
