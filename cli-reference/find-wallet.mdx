```

  --userID "user_12345" \
  --json
```

## Response

  - Wallet Address: 9WzDXwBbmkg8ZTbNMqUxvQRAyrZzDsGYdLVL9zYtAWWM
```

### Success Response (Formatted) - Not Found

### JSON Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Wallet association found.",
  "data": {
    "searchType": "userID",
    "searchValue": "user_12345",
    "relation": {
      "userId": "user_12345",
      "walletAddress": "9WzDXwBbmkg8ZTbNMqUxvQRAyrZzDsGYdLVL9zYtAWWM",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z",
      "relationPDA": "xyz789abc123def456ghi..."
    }
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

Common error scenarios:

- **No search criteria**: You must provide exactly one of user ID or wallet address
- **Both criteria provided**: Cannot search with both user ID and wallet address simultaneously
- **Invalid input format**: Ensure wallet addresses are valid Solana addresses
- **Network issues**: Check your internet connection and API availability

## Use Cases

### Verify User-Wallet Association

```bash
# Check if a specific user has a wallet
core-api-cli find-wallet --userID "user_12345"
```

### Lookup User by Wallet

```bash
# Find which user owns a specific wallet
core-api-cli find-wallet \
  --walletAddress "9WzDXwBbmkg8ZTbNMqUxvQRAyrZzDsGYdLVL9zYtAWWM"
```

### Automation Scripts

```bash
#!/bin/bash
result=$(core-api-cli find-wallet --userID "$1" --json)
if echo "$result" | jq -e '.data.relation' > /dev/null; then
  echo "User has associated wallet"
  echo "$result" | jq -r '.data.relation.walletAddress'
else
  echo "No wallet found for user"
fi
```

## Notes

- This command searches for existing associations created by the `link-wallet` command
- The search works bidirectionally - you can find a user by wallet or wallet by user
- Results include metadata about when the association was created
- The relation PDA is the blockchain address where this association is stored
