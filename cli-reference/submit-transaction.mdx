# Trust Engine submit-transaction

> Submit a signed transaction to the network

The submit-transaction command allows you to submit a signed transaction to the Solana network. This is typically used when a previous command (like register) returns a transaction that requires client-side signing before submission.

To use it, run the following command from your terminal

```bash
trust-engine-cli submit-transaction [options]
```

## Options

| Option                  | Description                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `-t, --transaction <data>` | Signed transaction in base64 format |
| `--json`                | Output the result as JSON             |

## Example

Submit a signed transaction:

```bash
trust-engine-cli submit-transaction --transaction "eJzTYmBkYGBkZWBgZGZgYGRhYGBkZmBgZGVgYGRmYGBkZWBgZGZgYGRh..."
```

After running the command, you'll see transaction confirmation:

```
✅ Transaction submitted successfully to the network.

Transaction Details:
  - Transaction Signature: 5J7X2vK8mWzNfEtY2jDw5mVpL1WzNfEtYKJH2mNqR3pB
  - Explorer URL: https://explorer.solana.com/address/5J7X2vK8mWzNfEtY2jDw5mVpL1WzNfEtYKJH2mNqR3pB?cluster=devnet
```

For automation purposes, use the JSON output:

```bash
trust-engine-cli submit-transaction --transaction "eJzTYmBkYGBkZWBgZGZgYGRhYGBkZmBgZGVgYGRmYGBkZWBgZGZgYGRh..." --json
```

This will return:

```json
{
  "message": "Transaction submitted successfully to the network.",
  "details": {
    "transactionId": "5J7X2vK8mWzNfEtY2jDw5mVpL1WzNfEtYKJH2mNqR3pB",
    "explorerUrl": "https://explorer.solana.com/address/5J7X2vK8mWzNfEtY2jDw5mVpL1WzNfEtYKJH2mNqR3pB?cluster=devnet"
  }
}
```

## When to Use

This command is typically used in a two-step process:

1. **Step 1**: Run a command like `register` that requires client-side signing
2. **Step 2**: Sign the returned transaction with your wallet
3. **Step 3**: Submit the signed transaction using this command

For example, if `register` returns:

```
✅ Registration prepared. Please sign the transaction.

Registration Details:
  - Status: requires-client-signature
  - Sign the transaction using your wallet and submit it using the following command:
    trust-engine-cli submit-transaction --transaction <signed_base64_transaction>
  - Transaction (Base64): eJzTYmBkYGBkZWBgZGZgYGRhYGBkZmBgZGVgYGRmYGBkZWBgZGZgYGRh...
```

You would:
1. Copy the base64 transaction
2. Sign it with your wallet software
3. Submit the signed transaction using this command
