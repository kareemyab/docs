## The Problem We Solve

AI-generated media is on a rapidly exponential rise, and it's now become indistinguishable from real digital media. **Consumers can't reliably verify who made what**. This fuels misinformation, fraud, and erodes trust in digital media.

<Warning>
**The Stakes Are High**: Global financial damages from deepfake-enabled fraud may approach or exceed **$40 billion** ([Deloitte, 2024](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/deepfake-banking-fraud-risk-on-the-rise.html)). 

The average cost per deepfake scam incident to businesses is approximately **$500,000** ([Regula, 2024](https://regulaforensics.com/blog/impact-of-deepfakes-on-idv-regula-survey/); [Eftsure, 2025](https://www.eftsure.com/statistics/deepfake-statistics/)).

## How Trust Engine Works

Trust Engine provides **privacy-preserving <Tooltip tip="A record of who registered digital media on our protocol and when - establishing a connection between the registrant and their claimed digital media piece">provenance</Tooltip> records** at the moment of creation or distribution.

<Info>
**What Trust Engine Does:** Creates immutable, timestamped records of who registered digital media on our protocol and when.
</Info>

<Warning>
**What Trust Engine Does NOT Do:**
- Determine rightful ownership or settle disputes
- Judge whether media is AI-generated vs. human-created  
- Make claims about media accuracy or editorial truth
- Act as arbiters of what's politically correct or appropriate
</Warning>

### Two-Party Architecture

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Creators">
    **Submit digital media piece** and register proofs of ownership and origin
    - Upload files via REST API
    - Generate cryptographic proofs
    - Receive immutable timestamps
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Public Verification">
    **Anyone can check** digital media provenance without intermediaries
    - Query public records
    - No central authority required
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
