## The Problem We Solve

AI-generated media is on a rapidly exponential rise, and it's now become indistinguishable from real digital media. **Consumers can't reliably verify who made what**. This fuels misinformation, fraud, and erodes trust in digital media.

<Warning>
**The Stakes Are High**: Global financial damages from deepfake-enabled fraud may approach or exceed **$40 billion** ([Deloitte, 2024](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/deepfake-banking-fraud-risk-on-the-rise.html)). 

The average cost per deepfake scam incident to businesses is approximately **$500,000** ([Regula, 2024](https://regulaforensics.com/blog/impact-of-deepfakes-on-idv-regula-survey/); [Eftsure, 2025](https://www.eftsure.com/statistics/deepfake-statistics/)).

## How Trust Engine Works

Trust Engine provides **privacy-preserving <Tooltip tip="A record of who registered digital media on our protocol and when - establishing a connection between the registrant and their claimed digital media piece">provenance</Tooltip> records** at the moment of creation or distribution.

<Info>
**What Trust Engine Does:** Creates immutable, timestamped records of who registered digital media on our protocol and when.
</Info>

<Warning>
**What Trust Engine Does NOT Do:**
- Determine rightful ownership or settle disputes
- Judge whether media is AI-generated vs. human-created  
- Make claims about media accuracy or editorial truth
- Act as arbiters of what's politically correct or appropriate
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register">
    Creators register their digital media in seconds without exposing contents. Files are hashed and metadata stored securely.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify">
    A decentralized network of independent verifiers checks registrations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Anyone can instantly verify origin and integrity through our public records and APIs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Three-Party Architecture

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Creators">
    **Submit digital media piece** and register proofs of ownership and origin
    - Upload files via REST API
    - Generate cryptographic proofs
    - Receive immutable timestamps
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Verifiers">
    **Independent validators** on a decentralized network authenticate media
    - Raw media piece never exposed
    - Reach consensus
    - Prevent lazy verification through economic incentives
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Public Verification">
    **Anyone can check** digital media provenance without intermediaries
    - Query public records
    - Verify cryptographic proofs
    - No central authority required
  </Tab>

## What Makes Us Different

Traditional solutions like watermarks or centralized databases are **prone to forgery and single points of failure**. Trust Engine introduces **Proof of Verification (PoV)** ‚Äî solving the lazy verification problem by creating economic incentives for thorough validation.

<Tip>
**Key Insight**: Just as Bitcoin's Proof of Work solved double spending and Peercoin's Proof of Stake improved security economics, Trust Engine's Proof of Verification solves the lazy verification problem in digital media authentication.
