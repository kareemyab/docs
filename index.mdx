## The Problem We Solve

AI-generated media is on a rapidly exponential rise, and it's now become indistinguishable from real content. **Consumers can't reliably verify who made what**. This fuels misinformation, fraud, and erodes trust in digital media.

<Warning>
**The Stakes Are High**: Global financial damages from deepfake-enabled fraud may approach or exceed **$40 billion** ([Deloitte, 2024](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/deepfake-banking-fraud-risk-on-the-rise.html)). 

The average cost per deepfake scam incident to businesses is approximately **$500,000** ([Regula, 2024](https://regulaforensics.com/blog/impact-of-deepfakes-on-idv-regula-survey/); [Eftsure, 2025](https://www.eftsure.com/statistics/deepfake-statistics/)).

## How Trust Engine Works

Trust Engine provides **privacy-preserving <Tooltip tip="A record of who registered digital media on our protocol and when - establishing a connection between the registrant and their claimed digital media piece">provenance</Tooltip> records** at the moment of creation or distribution.

<Info>
**What Trust Engine Does:** Creates immutable, timestamped records of who registered digital media on our protocol and when.
</Info>

<Warning>
**What Trust Engine Does NOT Do:**
- Determine rightful ownership or settle disputes
- Judge whether content is AI-generated vs. human-created  
- Make claims about content accuracy or editorial truth
- Act as arbiters of what's politically correct or appropriate
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register">
    Creators register their digital media in seconds without exposing contents. Files are hashed and metadata stored securely.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify">
    A decentralized network of independent verifiers checks registrations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Anyone can instantly verify origin and integrity through our public records and APIs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Three-Party Architecture

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Creators">
    **Submit content** and register proofs of ownership and origin
    - Upload files via REST API
    - Generate cryptographic proofs
    - Receive immutable timestamps
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Verifiers">
    **Independent validators** on a decentralized network authenticate content
    - Raw media piece never exposed
    - Reach consensus
    - Prevent lazy verification through economic incentives
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Public Verification">
    **Anyone can check** content provenance without intermediaries
    - Query public records
    - Verify cryptographic proofs
    - No central authority required
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## What Makes Us Different

Traditional solutions like watermarks or centralized databases are **prone to forgery and single points of failure**. Trust Engine introduces **Proof of Verification (PoV)** — solving the lazy verification problem by creating economic incentives for thorough validation.

<Tip>
**Key Insight**: Just as Bitcoin's Proof of Work solved double spending and Peercoin's Proof of Stake improved security economics, Trust Engine's Proof of Verification solves the lazy verification problem in content authentication.
