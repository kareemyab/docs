### Create a Wallet

Create a new Solana wallet for a user.

```

### Register a File

Register a file on the blockchain to create an immutable record.

```typescript
const file = new File(["content"], "example.txt", { type: "text/plain" });
const result = await sdk.registerFile({
  file,
  contentTitle: 'My Document',
  walletAddress: 'YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS',
  walletType: 'managed',
});
```

### Search for a File

Search for a file's registration record using the file itself.

```typescript
const file = new File(["content"], "example.txt", { type: "text/plain" });
const records = await sdk.searchFile(file);
```
