## Understanding Validator Metrics

### Performance Indicators

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Reputation Score">
    **Range**: 0-100
    
    **Calculation**: Based on historical voting accuracy and stake amount
    
    **Interpretation**:
    - **90-100**: Excellent validator with high trust
    - **70-89**: Good validator with solid performance
    - **50-69**: Average validator, monitor closely
    - **Below 50**: Poor performance, consider replacement
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Accuracy Percentage">
    **Formula**: `(honestVotes / totalVotes) * 100`
    
    **Meaning**: Percentage of correct validation decisions
    
    **Quality Levels**:
    - **â‰¥95%**: Exceptional accuracy
    - **85-94%**: Good accuracy
    - **70-84%**: Acceptable accuracy
    - **<70%**: Poor accuracy, needs improvement
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Activity Status">
    **Last Active Time**: Unix timestamp of most recent validation
    
    **Status Interpretation**:
    - **Recent (< 1 hour)**: Active validator
    - **Moderate (1-24 hours)**: Occasionally active
    - **Stale (> 24 hours)**: Inactive, may need attention
    - **Never**: Validator initialized but never participated
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Voting History

<Info>
**Total Votes**: Complete count of all validation decisions made

**Honest Votes**: Votes that aligned with network consensus (correct decisions)

**Dishonest Votes**: Votes that conflicted with consensus (incorrect decisions)
</Info>

<Warning>
**Data Freshness**: Validator data is updated based on on-chain activity. Recent validation votes may take a few minutes to be reflected in the metrics.
</Warning>

<Tip>
For production systems, implement caching for validator data with appropriate TTL (5-15 minutes) to reduce API calls while maintaining reasonable data freshness.
