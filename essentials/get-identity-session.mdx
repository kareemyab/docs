## Integration Tips

<Tip>
**Polling Strategy**: For real-time status updates, poll this endpoint periodically (every 30-60 seconds) while verification is pending.
</Tip>

<Info>
**Data Privacy**: Verified data is only returned when the session status is 'verified'. All other statuses return `verifiedData: null`.
</Info>

<Warning>
**Session Lifecycle**: Sessions expire after 24 hours. Check the `expiresAt` timestamp to determine if a new verification session needs to be created.
</Warning>
