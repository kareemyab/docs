## Wallet Type Flows

<Info>
**Important**: The response structure varies based on your `walletType` and `returnActionLink` parameter:

- **`"managed"`**: Automatic signing and submission - registration completes immediately with confirmed transaction
- **`"self"` with `returnActionLink: true`** *(Recommended)*: Returns an action link for secure browser-based transaction signing
- **`"self"` with `returnActionLink: false`**: Returns unsigned transaction that you must sign manually and submit via [`/transactions`](/essentials/submit-transaction)
</Info>

## Action Link Flow (Recommended for Self Wallets)

The action link flow provides a secure and user-friendly way to handle transaction signing for self wallets:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request with Action Link">
    Set `returnActionLink: true` in your request payload
  </Step>
  <Step title="Database Storage">
    The unsigned transaction and metadata are securely stored with a unique token
  </Step>
  <Step title="Action Link Response">
    Receive a secure link with the token (e.g., `http://trustengine.org/tx-action/abc123`)
  </Step>
  <Step title="User Signs Transaction">
    User visits the link and signs the transaction using their browser wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Registration Complete">
    Transaction is automatically submitted and registration is complete
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Action Link Benefits
- **Secure**: Transactions are stored server-side with expiring tokens
- **User-Friendly**: No need to handle raw transaction data
- **Browser-Compatible**: Works with all major Solana wallet extensions
- **Time-Limited**: Links expire after 24 hours for security
