# Getting Started with Identity Verification

Learn how to think about integrating **per-registration identity verification** into your application workflow.

<Info>
**Mental Model**: Identity verification is an **enhancement option for individual registrations**. Users choose whether to add verified identity based on the specific content they're registering. The `/register` endpoint automatically includes identity data when the user has recently completed verification for that registration.
</Info>

## Understanding the Flow

Identity verification happens in **3 simple steps**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Choice">
    When registering a file, users choose between:
    - **Standard**: Fast registration with blockchain proof
    - **Enhanced**: Standard + verified identity (adds ~2 minutes)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Identity Verification (if chosen)">
    If enhanced registration chosen:
    - Use `/register/identity` endpoint to start verification
    - User scans QR code with Self app on Trust Engine's verification page
    - Takes photos of government ID and selects what information to share
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic Integration">
    The `/register` endpoint automatically detects recent verification:
    - **If verification completed**: Includes verified identity data in registration
    - **If no recent verification**: Proceeds with standard registration only
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Users Need

Before offering identity verification, users need:

**üì± Device Requirements**
- Smartphone with camera
- **Self app** (free download from [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/self-crypto-super-app/id1459811885) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joinself.app))
- Internet connection

**üìÑ Document Requirements**  
- Government-issued photo ID
- Valid (not expired) documents
- Clear, well-lit environment for photos

**‚è±Ô∏è Time Requirement**
- About 2-3 minutes for verification
- One-time setup (faster for repeat use)

## Key User Messages

Help users understand what's happening:

**‚ùå Avoid saying**: "Identity verification is required"  
**‚úÖ Say instead**: "Add verified identity to enhance this registration"

**‚ùå Avoid saying**: "Upload your ID documents"  
**‚úÖ Say instead**: "Verify your identity securely - documents stay on your device"

**‚ùå Avoid saying**: "This will verify all your future registrations"  
**‚úÖ Say instead**: "Choose enhanced registration to include verified identity for this file"

**2. Add Identity Verification Option**
- Offer optional identity verification to users (usually one-time)
- Guide users through Self app download if needed  
- Redirect users to Trust Engine's verification page (no QR code implementation needed)

**3. Status Management**
- Poll verification status every 5-10 seconds
- Handle completion, failure, and timeout scenarios
- Provide clear user feedback throughout process

**4. Error Handling**
- Session expiration (24 hours) ‚Üí restart verification
- Verification failure ‚Üí help with better document photos
- Network issues ‚Üí implement retry logic

## Different Registration Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="üè† Personal Document">
  **User choice**: Standard registration (no identity)
  
  **Reasoning**: Personal photos, notes don't need identity verification
  
  **Result**: Fast, simple registration process
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="üìã Business Contract">
  **User choice**: Enhanced registration (name + nationality)
  
  **Reasoning**: Business partners want to know who they're contracting with
  
  **Result**: Verified identity adds legal weight to agreement
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="üè¶ Financial Document">
  **User choice**: Enhanced registration (full KYC fields)
  
  **Reasoning**: Regulatory compliance requires comprehensive identity
  
  **Result**: Meets KYC/AML requirements with blockchain immutability
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="üéì Academic Credential">
  **User choice**: Enhanced registration (name + date of birth)
  
  **Reasoning**: Credential authenticity requires identity confirmation
  
  **Result**: Verifiable credentials that employers/institutions can trust
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What Happens After Verification

Once a user completes identity verification for a registration:

‚úÖ **Automatic inclusion**: The `/register` endpoint detects recent verification and includes identity data  
‚úÖ **Enhanced credibility**: That specific registration gains verified authorship  
‚úÖ **Search benefits**: When others search for that file, they see verified authorship  
‚úÖ **Compliance ready**: That registration meets KYC/AML requirements

## Common Questions

**Q: Do users have to verify for every registration?**  
A: Only if they want that specific registration to include verified identity. Each registration is a separate choice.

**Q: What if users don't want to verify their identity?**  
A: That's fine! They can always use standard registration. Verification is completely optional.

**Q: Can users choose which identity fields to verify for each registration?**  
A: Yes! Users can choose different identity fields to verify based on what that specific registration requires.

**Q: What if verification fails?**  
A: Usually due to photo quality. Users can retry immediately with better lighting/positioning.

## Development & Testing

### Testing Without Real Documents

**Development Environment Setup:**

```typescript
// Use development mock for testing
const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';

const mockSDK = {
  async verifyIdentity({ walletAddress, disclosures }: {
    walletAddress: string;
    disclosures: {
      issuing_state: boolean;
      name: boolean;
      nationality: boolean;
      date_of_birth: boolean;
      passport_number: boolean;
      gender: boolean;
      expiry_date: boolean;
    }
  }) {
    console.log('üîß Mock: Starting verification for', walletAddress);
    return {
      details: {
        qrCodeUrl: `https://trustengine.org/verify?wallet=${walletAddress}`, // URL to verification page
        status: 'pending'
      }
    };
  },
  
  async checkIdentityStatus(walletAddress) {
    // Auto-complete after 3 seconds for testing
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));
    return {
      details: {
        status: 'verified',
        verifiedData: {
          verified_name: 'Test Developer',
          verified_nationality: 'United States',
          verified_date_of_birth: '1990-01-01'
        }
      }
    };
  }
};

// Use mock in development, real SDK in production
const sdk = isDevelopment ? mockSDK : new TrustEngineSDK();
```

**Demo Mode for Stakeholders:**
- Mock SDK completes verification in 3 seconds
- Returns realistic test data for demonstrations
- No real identity documents required for testing
- Mock URLs can redirect to demo pages for stakeholder presentations

### Integration Timeline

**Development Effort Estimates:**

**Basic Integration (API):** 0.5-1 developer days

- Retry logic and edge case handling

### Performance Considerations

**Status Polling Best Practices:**
```typescript
// Efficient polling with exponential backoff
const pollWithBackoff = async (walletAddress) => {
  let attempts = 0;
  const maxAttempts = 20; // 5 minutes max
  
  const poll = async () => {
    try {
      const status = await sdk.checkIdentityStatus(walletAddress);
      
      if (status.details.status !== 'pending') {
        return status; // Completed
      }
      
      if (attempts >= maxAttempts) {
        throw new Error('Polling timeout - session may have expired');
      }
      
      // Exponential backoff: 5s, 10s, 15s, max 30s
      const delay = Math.min(30000, 5000 + (attempts * 5000));
      attempts++;
      
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
      return poll();
      
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Polling error:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  };
  
  return poll();
};
```

**Performance Impact:**
- Polling requests: ~1KB each, every 5-30 seconds
- Minimal bandwidth impact
- Consider WebSocket alternatives for high-traffic apps
- QR code page: Simple redirect - no additional implementation needed

### User Communication Templates

**Pre-Verification Messaging:**

```typescript
const getContextualMessage = (documentType) => {
  const messages = {
    legal: {
      headline: "Add verified identity for legal authenticity",
      benefit: "Courts and partners can verify document authenticity",
      cta: "Add Legal Verification"
    },
    business: {
      headline: "Enhance credibility with verified authorship", 
      benefit: "Business partners can trust verified identity",
      cta: "Add Business Verification"
    },
    personal: {
      headline: "Optional: Add verified identity for trust",
      benefit: "Increases trust if you plan to share this document",
      cta: "Add Optional Verification"
    }
  };
  
  return messages[documentType] || messages.personal;
};
```

**During Verification:**
- ‚úÖ "You'll be redirected to complete verification with the Self app"
- ‚úÖ "Your ID photos are processed securely on your device only"  
- ‚úÖ "This usually takes 1-2 minutes to complete"

**Error Recovery:**
- ‚ùå "Verification failed - try retaking photos with better lighting"
- ‚è∞ "Session expired - tap to start new verification"
- üåê "Connection issue - tap to retry"
