# FAQ & Troubleshooting

Quick answers to common questions plus troubleshooting for integration issues.

## Common Issues & Solutions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="🔄 Verification session expired (24 hours)">
  **Problem**: User sees "session expired" message
  
  **Solution**: Start a new verification session
  ```typescript
  // Simply call verifyIdentity again
  const newVerification = await sdk.verifyIdentity({
    walletAddress,
    disclosures: { name: true, nationality: true }
  });
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="❌ Verification failed - poor document quality">
  **Problem**: Most common verification failure
  
  **Solutions**:
  - Better lighting (avoid shadows and glare)
  - Ensure entire document is in frame
  - Use flat, dark background surface
  - Make sure all text is clearly readable
  
  **User messaging**: "Try retaking photos with better lighting and ensure all text is visible"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="⚠️ Network errors during status polling">
  **Problem**: API timeouts or network failures
  
  **Solution**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
  ```typescript
  const checkStatusWithRetry = async (walletAddress, retries = 3) => {
    try {
      return await sdk.checkIdentityStatus(walletAddress);
    } catch (error) {
      if (retries > 0) {
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
        return checkStatusWithRetry(walletAddress, retries - 1);
      }
      throw error;
    }
  };
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="🔍 'No verification session found' error">
  **Problem**: Trying to check status for non-existent session
  
  **Solutions**:
  - Verify wallet address is correct
  - Check if session was created successfully
  - Handle case where user hasn't started verification yet
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Development Questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How do I handle Self.xyz service reliability?">
  **Service uptime**: Self.xyz maintains 99.9% uptime with global CDN infrastructure.
  
  **Graceful degradation approach**:
  ```typescript
  const startVerificationWithFallback = async (walletAddress, disclosures) => {
    try {
      return await sdk.verifyIdentity({ walletAddress, disclosures });
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.message.includes('service unavailable')) {
        // Show user-friendly message and allow retry later
        return {
          error: 'service_unavailable',
          message: 'Identity verification is temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a few minutes.',
          retryAfter: 300000 // 5 minutes
        };
      }
      throw error; // Re-throw other errors
    }
  };
  ```
  
  **Best practices**:
  - Always provide fallback to standard registration
  - Show clear status messages during outages
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I handle 24-hour session expiration UX?">
  **User experience approach**:
  
  ```typescript
  const handleExpiredSession = async (walletAddress) => {
    // Check if session is close to expiring (within 2 hours)
    const status = await sdk.checkIdentityStatus(walletAddress);
    const expiresAt = new Date(status.details.expiresAt);
    const now = new Date();
    const hoursUntilExpiry = (expiresAt - now) / (1000 * 60 * 60);
    
    if (hoursUntilExpiry < 2) {
      // Warn user and suggest completing soon
      showExpirationWarning(hoursUntilExpiry);
    }
    
    if (status.details.status === 'expired') {
      // Auto-start new session
      return sdk.verifyIdentity({ walletAddress, disclosures });
    }
  };
  ```
  
  **UX recommendations**:
  - Warn users 2 hours before expiration
  - Auto-restart expired sessions when user returns
  - Don't make users manually handle expiration
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What edge cases should I plan for?">
  **Common edge cases and solutions**:
  
  **Network interruption during verification**:
  ```typescript
  // Implement robust status checking
  const checkStatusWithRetry = async (walletAddress, maxRetries = 3) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
      try {
        return await sdk.checkIdentityStatus(walletAddress);
      } catch (error) {
        if (i === maxRetries - 1) throw error;
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000 * (i + 1)));
      }
    }
  };
  ```
  
  **User closes app mid-verification**:
  - Session persists for 24 hours
  - User can return and complete later
  - Poll status when user returns to app
  
  **Multiple devices/tabs**:
  - Verification sessions are wallet-specific
  - Status updates across all tabs polling same wallet
  - Handle concurrent polling gracefully
  
  **Document rejection scenarios**:
  - Poor lighting → Guide user to better environment
  - Expired documents → Suggest using different ID
  - Unsupported document types → List supported formats
</Accordion>

## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why do users need to download the Self app?">
  **The Self app is required** for secure identity verification. Here's why:
  
  - **Local processing**: ID documents are analyzed on the user's device only - never uploaded to servers
  - **Zero-knowledge proofs**: The app generates cryptographic proofs without exposing raw document data
  - **User control**: Users choose exactly what information to share for each verification
  - **One-time setup**: Once installed, users can verify identity for any Self.xyz-integrated service
  
  **Download links**:
  - [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/self-crypto-super-app/id1459811885)
  - [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joinself.app)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is Self.xyz and why is it required?">
  **Self.xyz** is a zero-knowledge identity verification platform that allows users to prove their identity without exposing sensitive personal information. Trust Engine integrates with Self.xyz to provide privacy-preserving identity verification.

  **Why Self.xyz?**
  - **Zero-knowledge proofs**: Users prove identity without sharing raw documents
  - **Selective disclosure**: Users control exactly what information to share
  - **Privacy-first**: No raw identity documents are stored anywhere
  - **Compliance-ready**: Meets regulatory requirements while preserving privacy

  **What users need**: The free Self app (iOS/Android) to complete verification.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How much does identity verification cost?">
  **For developers**: Identity verification is included with Trust Engine at no additional cost. You only pay standard Trust Engine usage fees.

  **For end users**: The Self app is free to download and use. Users don't pay anything for identity verification.

  **What's included**:
  - Unlimited identity verification sessions
  - All supported identity fields
  - Zero-knowledge proof generation
  - 24-hour session validity
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which countries and documents are supported?">
  **Documents supported**:
  - Government-issued passports (most countries worldwide)
  - Driver's licenses (varies by jurisdiction)
  - National ID cards (varies by country)
  - Must include a photo and be current/valid

  **Global coverage**: Self.xyz supports identity documents from most countries, but coverage may vary. The app will indicate if a specific document type is supported during the verification process.

  **Best compatibility**: International passports typically have the highest success rate across all regions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is identity verification required for Trust Engine?">
  **No, identity verification is optional.** Trust Engine works perfectly without identity verification:

  - **Basic mode**: Register files with wallet addresses only
  - **Enhanced mode**: Register files with verified identity data
  - **Flexible**: You can add identity verification to existing implementations
  - **User choice**: Let users decide whether to verify their identity

  However, identity verification adds significant value for compliance, trust, and fraud prevention.
</Accordion>
## User Experience Questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How do I handle users who resist downloading Self app?">
  **User concerns and responses**:
  
  **"Why another app?"**
  - "Self app keeps your documents on your device - more secure than uploading to websites"
  - "One-time download works with any service using Self.xyz"
  - "Free app, no in-app purchases or subscription"
  
  **"I don't trust it"**
  - Link to Self.xyz security information and certifications
  - Explain zero-knowledge technology in simple terms
  - Emphasize that documents never leave their device
  
  **Implementation approach**:
  ```typescript
  const handleAppDownloadResistance = () => {
    return {
      primaryAction: "Continue without verification",
      secondaryAction: "Learn about Self app security",
      messaging: "You can always add verification later - your choice!"
    };
  };
  ```
  
  **Best practices**:
  - Always offer standard registration as primary option
  - Present verification as enhancement, not requirement
  - Provide easy way to add verification later
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I handle the verification redirect?">
  **Simple implementation**:
  
  ```typescript
  const handleIdentityVerification = async (walletAddress) => {
    try {
      const response = await sdk.verifyIdentity({ 
        walletAddress, 
        disclosures: { name: true, nationality: true }
      });
      
      // Just redirect to the provided URL - Trust Engine handles the QR code display
      window.location.href = response.details.qrCodeUrl;
      
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to start verification:', error);
    }
  };
  ```
  
  **Implementation benefits**:
  - No QR code generation or display code needed
  - Trust Engine handles mobile vs desktop optimization
  - No additional UI components to maintain
  - Works seamlessly across all devices and platforms
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the typical user drop-off rate?">
  **Completion rates vary by context**:
  
  - **High-value documents** (legal, financial): 70-85% completion
  - **Business documents**: 60-75% completion  
  - **Optional verification**: 25-40% completion
  
  **Factors that improve completion**:
  - Clear value proposition for that specific document
  - Smooth onboarding with Self app explanation
  - Mobile-optimized UX
  - Contextual timing (right when user needs verification)
  
  **Implementation strategy**:
  - A/B testing different messaging approaches
  - Progressive disclosure - explain benefits gradually
  - Don't pressure users - make it genuinely optional
  - Measure completion rates for your specific use case
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Implementation Questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Do I need to modify my existing Trust Engine integration?">
  **No breaking changes required.** Identity verification is additive:

  **Existing functionality continues to work**:
  ```typescript
  // This still works exactly as before
  const result = await sdk.registerFile({
    file: myFile,
    contentTitle: "Document",
    walletAddress: userWallet,
    walletType: "managed"
  });
  ```

  **Add identity verification incrementally**:
  ```typescript
  // New: Optional identity verification
  await sdk.verifyIdentity({
    walletAddress: userWallet,
    disclosures: { name: true, nationality: true }
  });

  // Registration will include verified identity if verification was recent
  const enhancedResult = await sdk.registerFile({...});
  ```

  **Migration path**: Start with optional verification, then make it required for specific file types or user tiers.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I check if a user is already verified?">
  **Use the status checking methods**:

  ```typescript
  // Check current verification status
  const status = await sdk.checkIdentityStatus(walletAddress);

  if (status.details.status === 'verified') {
    console.log('User is verified');
    console.log('Verified data:', status.details.verifiedData);
  } else {
    console.log('User needs verification');
    // Start verification process
  }
  ```

  **Status values**:
  - `'verified'` - Identity successfully verified
  - `'pending'` - Verification in progress
  - `'failed'` - Verification failed
  - `'expired'` - Session expired (24 hours)
  - No session - User has never started verification

  **Best practice**: Always check status before starting new verification sessions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I require specific identity fields?">
  **Yes, you have full control over required fields**:

  ```typescript
  // Minimal verification - just age proof
  const ageVerification = {
    date_of_birth: true,
    name: false,
    nationality: false
  };

  // KYC compliance verification
  const kycVerification = {
    name: true,
    nationality: true,
    date_of_birth: true,
    issuing_state: true,
    expiry_date: true
  };

  // Full identity verification
  const fullVerification = {
    name: true,
    nationality: true,
    date_of_birth: true,
    issuing_state: true,
    passport_number: true,
    gender: true,
    expiry_date: true
  };

  await sdk.verifyIdentity({
    walletAddress,
    disclosures: kycVerification // Choose your requirements
  });
  ```

  **Field validation**: At least one field must be `true`, but you can require any combination.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I handle verification for existing users?">
  **Gradual rollout approach**:

  ```typescript
  const handleExistingUser = async (userID: string) => {
    try {
      // Check if user already has verification
      const wallet = await sdk.findWallet({ userID });
      const status = await sdk.checkIdentityStatus(wallet.details.relation.walletAddress);
      
      if (status.details.status === 'verified') {
        return { alreadyVerified: true, data: status.details.verifiedData };
      }
    } catch (error) {
      // User doesn't have verification yet
    }

    // Offer optional verification
    return { alreadyVerified: false, canVerify: true };
  };

  // Usage in UI
  const userStatus = await handleExistingUser(currentUserID);
  
  if (!userStatus.alreadyVerified) {
    // Show optional verification prompt
    showVerificationOffer();
  }
  ```

  **Strategies**:
  - **Optional upgrade**: Offer verification as an enhancement
  - **Required for new features**: Require verification for premium features
  - **Gradual enforcement**: Start optional, then require for sensitive operations
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## User Experience Questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What do users need to complete verification?">
  **Requirements for users**:
  
  **Device & Software**:
  - Smartphone (iOS or Android)
  - The free Self app (downloaded from app stores)
  - Camera access for document scanning
  - Internet connection

  **Documents**:
  - Government-issued photo ID (passport, driver's license, national ID)
  - Document must be current and valid (not expired)
  - High-quality, clear photos

  **Time**:
  - About 2-3 minutes for the verification process

  **Privacy**:
  - Control over what information to share
  - Documents processed locally on their device
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long does verification take?">
  **Typical timeline**:
  - **Verification URL creation**: Instant
  - **User verification in Self app**: 2-3 minutes
  - **Result processing**: Usually under 30 seconds
  - **Total time**: 3-5 minutes for most users

  **Factors affecting time**:
  - Document photo quality (retakes may be needed)
  - User familiarity with the Self app
  - Internet connection speed
  - Document type and issuing authority

  **Session expiration**: 24 hours (users can complete at their own pace)

  **Monitoring**: Use status polling to detect completion in real-time
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if users don't have smartphones?">
  **Current limitation**: Self.xyz verification requires a smartphone with the Self app. This is because:
  - Document scanning requires high-quality camera
  - Facial recognition needs live selfie capability
  - Security model requires local processing

  **Alternatives for non-smartphone users**:
  - Allow basic file registration without verification
  - Provide verification as optional enhancement
  - Consider traditional KYC services for edge cases
  - Partner with Self.xyz for potential future web-based solutions

  **Recommendation**: Make identity verification optional to accommodate all users.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can users share verification across multiple applications?">
  **Important**: Users still need to choose per-registration whether to include identity verification, but verified identity data can be shared across Trust Engine applications.

  **Cross-application usage**:
  ```typescript
  // User verifies for a registration in App A
  await sdk.verifyIdentity({ walletAddress: "abc123...", disclosures: {...} });

  // Later, in App B (same wallet), they can check existing verification status
  const status = await sdk.checkIdentityStatus("abc123...");
  // If recent verification exists: status.details.status === 'verified' ✅
  ```

  **How it works**: Each application still requires users to choose enhanced registration with identity verification, but the underlying identity data can be reused if recently verified.

  **Benefits**:
  - Users don't need to re-verify identity documents across applications
  - Faster enhanced registration process in subsequent applications
  - Consistent identity data across the Trust Engine ecosystem
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security and Privacy Questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How secure is the identity verification process?">
  **Security measures**:

  **Document Processing**:
  - All document analysis happens locally on the user's device
  - Raw documents never leave the user's phone
  - AI verification detects fraudulent or tampered documents

  **Data Transmission**:
  - Only zero-knowledge proofs are transmitted (not raw data)
  - All communications use HTTPS encryption
  - Cryptographic signatures prevent tampering

  **Storage**:
  - No raw identity documents stored anywhere
  - Only verified claims (not original data) recorded on blockchain
  - User maintains full control over their identity data

  **Privacy Protection**:
  - Users choose exactly what information to share
  - Selective disclosure prevents over-sharing
  - Zero-knowledge proofs mathematically verify claims without exposing data
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What data is stored and where?">
  **What Trust Engine stores**:
  - Verification status (verified/pending/failed)
  - Cryptographic proofs (not readable data)
  - Requested disclosure fields (boolean flags)
  - Timestamps (creation, verification, expiration)

  **What Self.xyz stores**:
  - User account and wallet information (encrypted)
  - Verification proofs and signatures
  - No raw identity documents

  **What is NOT stored**:
  - Raw document scans or photos
  - Full identity information
  - Facial recognition data
  - Unencrypted personal information

  **Blockchain records**:
  - Cryptographic hashes only
  - No readable personal information
  - Immutable verification proofs
  - Privacy-preserving by design
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can verification data be deleted or updated?">
  **Data lifecycle**:

  **Verification sessions**:
  - Expire after 24 hours if not completed
  - Can be overwritten by new verification attempts
  - Failed sessions don't persist long-term

  **Verified identity data**:
  - Persists for the lifetime of the wallet relationship
  - Can be updated by completing new verification with different disclosure fields
  - Cannot be selectively deleted (maintain audit trail)

  **User control**:
  - Users can always create new verification sessions
  - Self.xyz users can manage their data through the Self app
  - Wallet relationships can be recreated if needed

  **Compliance**: 
  - Follows GDPR and data protection regulations
  - Users maintain rights over their identity data
  - Trust Engine provides data access and deletion mechanisms where legally required
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is this compliant with privacy regulations?">
  **GDPR Compliance**:
  - ✅ Minimal data collection (only requested fields)
  - ✅ User consent for each verification session
  - ✅ Data minimization (zero-knowledge proofs)
  - ✅ Right to explanation (clear verification process)

  **CCPA Compliance**:
  - ✅ Clear privacy notice about data use
  - ✅ User control over shared information
  - ✅ Data deletion rights where applicable

  **Other Regulations**:
  - **KYC/AML**: Supports compliance while preserving privacy
  - **HIPAA**: No health information collected by default
  - **Financial Services**: Meets identity verification requirements

  **Privacy-by-Design**: The zero-knowledge approach inherently supports privacy regulations by minimizing data exposure and processing.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical Questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How do I handle network failures during verification?">
  **Implement robust error handling**:

  ```typescript
  const robustVerification = async (walletAddress: string, disclosures: any) => {
    const maxRetries = 3;
    let attempt = 0;

    while (attempt < maxRetries) {
      try {
        const result = await sdk.verifyIdentity({ walletAddress, disclosures });
        return result;
      } catch (error) {
        attempt++;
        
        if (error.code === 'NETWORK_ERROR' && attempt < maxRetries) {
          console.log(`Attempt ${attempt} failed, retrying...`);
          await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000 * attempt));
          continue;
        }
        
        throw error; // Re-throw if not a network error or max retries reached
      }
    }
  };
  ```

  **Best practices**:
  - Implement exponential backoff for retries
  - Show user-friendly error messages
  - Allow manual retry options
  - Save progress where possible
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I test identity verification in development?">
  **Development strategies**:

  **Environment separation**:
  ```typescript
  const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';

  // Use mock data in development
  if (isDevelopment) {
    return mockVerificationData;
  } else {
    return await sdk.checkIdentityStatus(walletAddress);
  }
  ```

  **Testing approaches**:
  - Create mock verification responses for automated tests
  - Use staging environment with test wallets
  - Implement feature flags to enable/disable verification
  - Test error scenarios with network simulation

  **Mock data structure**:
  ```typescript
  const mockVerifiedData = {
    verified_name: "Test User",
    verified_nationality: "Test Country",
    verified_date_of_birth: "1990-01-01",
    // ... other fields as needed
  };
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I customize the verification fields for different user types?">
  **Yes, create verification profiles**:

  ```typescript
  const verificationProfiles = {
    basic: {
      name: false,
      nationality: false,
      date_of_birth: true // Age verification only
    },
    
    standard: {
      name: true,
      nationality: true,
      date_of_birth: true
    },
    
    premium: {
      name: true,
      nationality: true,
      date_of_birth: true,
      issuing_state: true,
      expiry_date: true
    },
    
    compliance: {
      name: true,
      nationality: true,
      date_of_birth: true,
      issuing_state: true,
      passport_number: true,
      expiry_date: true
    }
  };

  // Usage based on user tier or file type
  const getRequiredVerification = (userTier: string, fileType: string) => {
    if (fileType === 'legal_document') return verificationProfiles.compliance;
    if (userTier === 'premium') return verificationProfiles.premium;
    return verificationProfiles.standard;
  };
  ```

  **Dynamic requirements**: Adjust verification requirements based on file sensitivity, user tier, or regulatory requirements.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I migrate from other identity verification services?">
  **Migration strategy**:

  **1. Parallel implementation** (recommended):
  ```typescript
  const hybridVerification = async (userID: string) => {
    // Check Trust Engine verification first
    try {
      const trustEngineStatus = await checkTrustEngineVerification(userID);
      if (trustEngineStatus.verified) {
        return { provider: 'trustengine', data: trustEngineStatus };
      }
    } catch (error) {
      // Fall back to existing service
    }

    // Check existing service
    const existingStatus = await checkExistingService(userID);
    return { provider: 'existing', data: existingStatus };
  };
  ```

  **2. Gradual transition**:
  - Start with new users on Trust Engine
  - Offer existing users optional migration
  - Maintain both systems during transition period
  - Eventually phase out old system

  **3. Data mapping**:
  ```typescript
  const mapExistingData = (oldData: any) => {
    return {
      name: oldData.full_name,
      nationality: oldData.country,
      date_of_birth: oldData.birth_date,
      // Map other fields as needed
    };
  };
  ```

  **Migration benefits**: Zero-knowledge privacy, better user experience, integrated with file registration.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Users report verification is 'stuck' or not completing">
  **Common causes and solutions**:

  **1. Session timeout**:
  ```typescript
  const checkSessionExpiry = async (walletAddress: string) => {
    const status = await sdk.checkIdentityStatus(walletAddress);
    
    if (status.details.status === 'expired') {
      // Start new session
      return await sdk.verifyIdentity({ walletAddress, disclosures });
    }
    
    return status;
  };
  ```

  **2. App issues**:
  - User needs to update Self app
  - User needs to restart app
  - User needs to check internet connection

  **3. Document issues**:
  - Poor lighting in photos
  - Expired documents
  - Unsupported document types

  **Prevention**: Provide clear instructions and troubleshooting tips in your UI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Error: 'No verification session found'">
  **This error occurs when**:
  - User never started verification
  - Session expired (24 hours)
  - Wallet address doesn't match

  **Solution**:
  ```typescript
  const safeStatusCheck = async (walletAddress: string) => {
    try {
      return await sdk.checkIdentityStatus(walletAddress);
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.statusCode === 404) {
        // No session exists, user needs to start verification
        return { needsVerification: true };
      }
      throw error;
    }
  };
  ```

  **Prevention**: Always handle the case where no verification session exists.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Verification works in testing but fails in production">
  **Check these factors**:

  **Environment configuration**:
  ```typescript
  // Ensure correct API endpoints
  const sdk = new TrustEngineSDK(
    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
      ? 'https://core-api-server.onrender.com'
      : 'http://localhost:3000'
  );
  ```

  **Common production issues**:
  - HTTPS requirements for camera access
  - CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
  - Rate limiting in production environment
  - Network firewall blocking API calls

  **Debugging steps**:
  - Check browser console for errors
  - Verify API responses in network tab
  - Test with production API keys
  - Validate SSL certificates
