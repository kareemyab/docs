# Identity Verification with Trust Engine

Trust Engine integrates with **Self.xyz**, a leading zero-knowledge (ZK) identity verification platform, to provide **per-registration identity verification**. Users can choose to verify their identity for specific file registrations, trading convenience for enhanced credibility and compliance.

<Info>
**Key Concept**: Identity verification is **optional for each registration**. Users can choose to add verified identity data to specific registrations. The `/register` endpoint automatically includes identity data when the user has recently completed verification for that registration.
</Info>

## 🚀 Quick Understanding

Identity verification works **per-registration**:

1. **User decides**: For this registration, do I want to include verified identity?
2. **If yes**: User completes verification process (~2 minutes with Self app)  
3. **Automatic inclusion**: `/register` endpoint detects recent verification and includes identity data
4. **If no**: Registration proceeds with just file + blockchain proof

**The convenience**: Users choose per-registration, and the system automatically includes verification data when present.

**Perfect for**:
- ✅ Feature development without real ID uploads
- ✅ Stakeholder demonstrations  
- ✅ Integration testing with predictable results
- ✅ UI/UX iteration without Self app dependency

## What Users Need: Self App Download

<Warning>
**Critical Requirement**: Users must download the **Self app** (iOS/Android) to complete identity verification. This is a free app that processes ID documents securely on their device.
</Warning>

**How it works**:
1. User chooses enhanced registration with identity verification
2. Your app redirects user to Trust Engine's verification page  
3. User scans QR code with Self app (downloads if needed)
4. Self app guides them through secure ID verification
5. Registration automatically includes verified identity data

**Self App Links**:
- [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/self-crypto-super-app/id1459811885)
- [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joinself.app)

## Why Use Identity Verification?

<Info>
**Design Rationale**: Per-registration verification allows users to match identity disclosure to content sensitivity. A casual document might not need identity, while legal contracts benefit from verified authorship.
</Info>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Flexible Credibility" icon="shield-check">
    Users choose when to add verified identity - trading convenience for enhanced trust per registration
  </Card>
  <Card title="Targeted Compliance" icon="scale-balanced">
    Meet KYC/AML requirements only when needed, while preserving privacy through zero-knowledge proofs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Selective Identity" icon="user-shield">
    Different registrations can verify different identity fields based on content requirements
  </Card>
  <Card title="Always Optional" icon="toggle-off">
    Users never lose functionality - they gain the option to enhance specific registrations with identity

### **Credibility Trade-offs**

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Standard Registration (No Identity)">
  **What happens**: File registered with wallet address only
  
  **Credibility level**: Basic blockchain proof of registration
  
  **Use cases**: Personal documents, casual sharing, low-stakes content
  
  **User effort**: Minimal - just file upload and registration
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Enhanced Registration (With Identity)">
  **What happens**: File registered with verified identity data attached
  
  **Credibility level**: High - blockchain proof + verified authorship
  
  **Use cases**: Legal documents, compliance requirements, high-value content
  
  **User effort**: Additional 2-3 minutes for identity verification via Self app
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What Gets Verified Per Registration?

For each file registration, users can choose to verify any combination of these identity fields:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Personal Information">
  - **Full Name** - Legal name from government ID
  - **Date of Birth** - Age verification and identity confirmation
  - **Nationality** - Citizenship or nationality from passport/ID
  - **Gender** - Gender as listed on official documents
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Document Information">
  - **Issuing State/Country** - Which government issued the ID document
  - **Document Number** - Passport or ID card number (if requested)
  - **Expiry Date** - When the ID document expires
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How It Benefits Your Application

### For Developers
- **Simple Integration** - Add identity verification with just a few API calls and URL redirects

## Per-Registration Use Cases

<Info>
**Key Insight**: Different documents need different levels of identity verification. Users can tailor identity disclosure to match content sensitivity and requirements.
</Info>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="🏠 Personal Document (No Identity Needed)">
  **Example**: Family photo, personal note
  
  **Registration choice**: Standard (no identity verification)
  
  **Rationale**: Content is personal/casual, no compliance requirements
  
  **Result**: Fast registration, basic blockchain proof
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="📋 Business Contract (Name + Nationality)">
  **Example**: Service agreement, partnership contract
  
  **Registration choice**: Verify name and nationality only
  
  **Rationale**: Parties need to know who they're contracting with, but not full identity details
  
  **Result**: Legally meaningful while preserving privacy
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="🏦 Financial Document (Full KYC Verification)">
  **Example**: Loan agreement, investment document
  
  **Registration choice**: Verify name, nationality, DOB, issuing state, document expiry
  
  **Rationale**: Regulatory compliance requires comprehensive identity verification
  
  **Result**: Meets KYC/AML requirements with blockchain immutability
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="🎓 Academic Credential (Name + Verification)">
  **Example**: Diploma, certificate, transcript
  
  **Registration choice**: Verify name and date of birth
  
  **Rationale**: Credential authenticity requires identity confirmation, but not full personal details
  
  **Result**: Verifiable credentials with appropriate privacy level
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### **Cross-Registration Flexibility**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Same User, Different Needs" icon="user-gear">
    One user might register a casual document (no identity) and a legal contract (full identity) on the same day
  </Card>
  <Card title="Progressive Requirements" icon="arrow-trend-up">
    Start with basic registration, then upgrade specific documents with identity as needs evolve
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Privacy & Security

Trust Engine's identity verification is built on privacy-first principles:

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** - Identity verified without exposing raw document data
- **Selective Disclosure** - Users choose exactly what information to share
- **No Document Storage** - Original identity documents never leave the user's device
- **Blockchain Immutability** - Verified claims are tamper-proof once recorded
- **Self-Sovereign Identity** - Users maintain full control over their identity data
