Trust Engine minimizes centralized data retention and uses cryptographic proofs and on-chain records to verify provenance. This page outlines our current security model and planned improvements.

## Core Security Principles

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Privacy by Design" icon="eye-slash">
    We do not retain centralized copies of your media. Files are processed transiently to compute a hash and pin to IPFS, then discarded
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Cryptographic Integrity" icon="key">
    SHA-256 is used for content fingerprinting and integrity verification
  </Card>

  
  <Card title="Immutable Records" icon="lock">
    On-chain records prevent retroactive tampering of provenance data
  </Card>

## Cryptographic Security

### Hash Functions

**SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)**:
- **Collision Resistance**: Computationally infeasible to find two inputs with same hash
- **Pre-image Resistance**: Cannot derive the original digital media piece from hash
- **Avalanche Effect**: Single bit change produces completely different hash

Used for file identity and integrity checks throughout Trust Engine.

### Digital Signatures

**Ed25519** (Solana self) for transactions:
- **Authentication**: Proves identity of the signer
- **Non-repudiation**: Signer cannot deny having signed
- **Integrity**: Detects any message tampering

### Key Management (Current)

**Server-side fee payer**: A managed wallet sponsors on-chain SOL fees for self flows.

**User wallets**: Non-custodial wallets are supported; managed wallets are available. Keep private keys secure (we never ask for user private keys).

<Info>
**Planned**: HSM custody, automated key rotation, enterprise multi-signature support

## Privacy Guarantees

**File contents**: Not centrally stored. For registration, we transiently process the file to derive its hash and pin to IPFS; the original bytes are discarded after processing.

**Search**: In the Registry UI, you can verify by hashing locally in the browser; the file never leaves your device. The API also supports server-side hashing; files are discarded after hashing.

**Metadata**: Only what you explicitly submit (title/description/custom fields). Avoid sensitive PII. If your file embeds EXIF or other metadata, strip it before upload or consider encrypting the asset you register.

**IPFS**: Content is content-addressed and publicly retrievable by CID. We pin to improve availability; we do not re-host a proprietary copy.

**On-chain**: Hashes, timestamps, and registration records are immutable.

## Data Minimization

**Stored on-chain**:
- Content hash (SHA-256), creator wallet, timestamp, IPFS CID(s)

**Not centrally stored**:
- Raw media bytes; file paths/names unless you include them in metadata

**Operational logs**:
- We keep minimal service logs (timestamps/status/errors) for reliability and abuse mitigation
- We do not log raw media
- We aim to avoid storing sensitive payloads in logs

## API Security (Current)

**Transport**: HTTPS/TLS for API communication.

**Validation & limits**: Basic payload validation and size limits in product surfaces; large/binary uploads are restricted to explicit endpoints.

<Info>
**Planned**: API keys for production integrations, adaptive rate limits, WAF/DDoS layers, certificate pinning (mobile), strict schema validation, magic-number file checks
</Info>

## Smart Contract Security

<Warning>
**Status**: Contracts are under active development and unaudited. We prioritize devnet/testnet usage for MVP.
</Warning>

**Planned**: Third-party audits, expanded test coverage, formal verification for critical paths.
